This project entailed a thorough refactor of HTML and CSS code to increase accessibility. Div tags were replaced with semantic HTML elements, alt tags were added to images, and CSS code was heavily reorganized/consolidated. I decided to organize the CSS rulesets first by increasing specificity (universal selectors, class selectors, element selectors, etc.) and then in order of appearance on the website within those specificity tiers.
